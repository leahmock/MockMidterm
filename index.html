	<h4>New Media for Social Change</h4>
	<h1>Physical Animation: Zoetrope</h1>
	<h4>Isabel Faustino, Leah Mock, and Juan Santiago</h4>
  	<p>During the making of our zoetropes, the first decision we made was the issue we would focus on. We chose climate change.</p>

	<p>Based on the box and arrow model we made, we decided to target an everyday behavior that most people partake in: transportation from place to place. Using cars produces large amounts of carbon emissions, so we decided to try to convince people to use bicycles, a cleaner and greener form of transportation.</p>
